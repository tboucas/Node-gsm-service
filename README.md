# Node-gsm-service
The app is a Node.js-based server application that interacts with a GSM modem to handle SMS messages and voice calls. It uses Express.js to create a RESTful API for initiating voice calls and managing an internal call queue. The application is structured to separate concerns, making it modular and easier to maintain.
